# transit-to
This project is from Hackathon International's #HackTO event. My group decided to tackle problem statement #2 which was as follows:

"How might we improve the safety and efficiency of Toronto traffic infrastructure for drivers and pedestrians to enable safe, efficient, equitable mobility for all?"

We decided to build an app where users are able to favorite their most frequent destinations e.g. work, gym, home etc, and then be able to receive notifications in case of
any service interruptions on those routes.

This is the backend of the application, built with Django.
